      <h2>Contract</h2>

        <p h2assName="contract">
          I, Matthew Scott agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER
          2025, FALL, ITIS3135-101 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
          <br /><br />
          I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools
          will be available to the world, and will not put information there that
          is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
          <br /><br />
          I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
          logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
          may show as absences.
          <br /><br />
          I also understand that given the structure and content of this class
          it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’
          code directly.
          <br /><br />
          I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut
          and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external
          libraries) and never from my classmates.
          <br /><br />
